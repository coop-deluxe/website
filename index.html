        <h1>What is Coop <span class="dx">Deluxe</span>?</h1>
        <p>We are a team of people working to make the best Super Mario 64 Co-op experience there is. Initially, the Coop Deluxe team started off as a group of people working on a fork for sm64ex-coop, but after days of discussion, we have merged together to be one team working on one big project.</p>
        <p><strong>sm64coop<span class="dx">dx</span></strong> is an online multiplayer project for the Super Mario 64 PC port, started by the Coop Deluxe Team. Its purpose is to actively maintain and improve, but also to continue sm64ex-coop, an original idea from djoslin0. More features, customizability, and power to the Lua API allow modders and players to enjoy Super Mario 64 more than ever!</p>

                <p>This is a graphically overhauled and functionally improved version of <span class="x">Agent X</span>'s technically impressive Day Night Cycle. Originally limited by the lack of graphical altering functionality in Lua and knowing trying to implement it would likely get turned down by the developers, <span class="x">Agent X</span> decided to only change the lighting direction and render a rectangle on the HUD to give the illusion of it being darker. This of course, didn't look very good, and now with the ability to change vertex color, light color, fog color, fog intensity the graphics of this mod have been majorly improved.</p>

        <h1>FAQs with <span class="x">Agent X</span></h1>
        <dl>
            <dt>Q: When is the Android port coming out?</dt>
            <dd>An Android port is not guaranteed as it will only exist if someone makes it. So yeah, we are not really the people who decide if there's an android port or not, and if we were, I would delay it by a month everytime someone asked about it.</dd>

            <dt>Q: Can I join the Discord server?</dt>
            <dd>A: Yes, the sm64coopdx server now has a <a href="https://discord.gg/TJVKHS4">public invite</a>.</dt>
        
            <dt>Q: Do I need the original sm64ex-coop for this?</dt>
            <dd>A: No, with the new update, all you have to do is <a href="https://github.com/coop-deluxe/sm64coopdx/releases/latest">download</a> the game and drag and drop a rom on the window.</dd>
            
            <dt>Q: Do I use coopdx-patcher?</dt>
            <dd>A: coopdx-patcher is no longer needed, neither is coop-compiler for sm64ex-coop. You can download sm64coopdx <a href="https://github.com/coop-deluxe/sm64coopdx/releases/latest">here</a></dd>

            <dt>Q: Where can I suggest things or report bugs if I'm not in the Discord?</dt>
            <dd>A: You can suggest things or report bugs on the GitHub repository OR the <a href="https://mods.sm64coopdx.com">new mod site</a>.</dd>
