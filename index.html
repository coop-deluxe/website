				<h3>What is Coop <span class="dx">Deluxe</span>?</h3>
				<p>We are a team of people working to make the best Super Mario 64 Co-op experience there is. Initially, the Coop Deluxe team started off as a group of people working on a fork for sm64ex-coop, but after days of discussion, we have merged together to be one team working on one big project.</p>
				<p><strong>sm64coop<span class="dx">dx</span></strong> is an online multiplayer project for the Super Mario 64 PC port, started by the Coop Deluxe Team. Its purpose is to actively maintain and improve, but also to continue sm64ex-coop, an original idea from djoslin0. More features, customizability, and power to the Lua API allow modders and players to enjoy Super Mario 64 more than ever!</p>

				<h3>sm64coop<span class="dx">dx</span> has shiny new built-in mods!</h3>
				<div class="container text-center">
					<div class="row g-4">
						<h4>Gun Mod <span class="dx">DX</span></h4>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<img src="gun1.png" alt="Gun Mod screenshot" width="100%" class="modimg">
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<img src="gun2.png" alt="Gun Mod screenshot" width="100%" class="modimg">
						</div>
						<p>This is a complete rewrite of <span>Agent X</span>'s first mod, Gun Mod. Originally made for sm64ex-coop and not made out to what it could be due to a lack of experience, the old Gun Mod was not the greatest and had much room for improvement. Taking the opportunity, <span>Agent X</span> decided this would be one of the two mods he was going to overhaul to be bundled in with <strong>sm64coop<span class="dx">dx</span></strong>.</p>
						<br>
						<h4>Day Night Cycle <span class="dx">DX</span></h4>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<img src="daynight1.png" alt="Day-Night Cycle screenshot" width="100%" class="modimg">
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<img src="daynight2.png" alt="Day-Night Cycle screenshot" width="100%" class="modimg">
						</div>
						<p>This is a graphically overhauled and functionally improved version of <span>Agent X</span>'s technically impressive Day Night Cycle. Originally limited by the lack of graphical altering functionality in Lua and knowing trying to implement it would likely get turned down by the developers, <span>Agent X</span> decided to only change the lighting direction and render a rectangle on the HUD to give the illusion of it being darker. This of course, didn't look very good, and now with the ability to change vertex color, light color, fog color, fog intensity the graphics of this mod have been majorly improved.</p>

				<h3>FAQs with <span>Agent X</span></h3>
				<dl>
					<dt class="fqa-question">Q: When is the Android port coming out?</dt>
					<dd class="fqa-answer">An Android port is not guarenteed as it will only exist if someone makes it. While I am against the idea of an Android port due to the kids mainly, I won't make an effort to stop someone if they do decide to make it. So yeah, we are not really the people who decide if there's an android port or not, and if we were, I would delay it by a month everytime someone asked about it.</dd>
					<dt class="fqa-question">Q: How do I join the Discord server?</dt>
					<dd class="fqa-answer">A: The Discord server is a closed server that gains new people by friend to friend inviting. We have it this way for two reasons. One, large public community servers <strong>fester toxicity</strong> quickly and are harder to moderate. Two, we want this server to be <strong>a chill place where people can talk and show off things,</strong> not a daycare center.</dd>
					<dt class="fqa-question">Q: Do I need the original sm64ex-coop for this?</dt>
					<dd class="fqa-answer">A: No, with the patcher all you need to do is drag a ROM onto it and it will automatically output an executable, no need for sm64ex-coop.</dd>
					<dt class="fqa-question">Q: Is the patcher cross-platform?</dt>
					<dd class="fqa-answer">A: It is Windows only, at least for now. I made it using .NET Framework 4.7 so older computers can run it without any compatibility issues.</dd>
					<dt class="fqa-question">Q: Where can I suggest things or report bugs if I'm not in the Discord?</dt>
					<dd class="fqa-answer">A: You can suggest things or report bugs on the GitHub repository OR the <a href="https://mods.sm64coopdx.com">new mod site</a>.</dd>
